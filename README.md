# hello-world
just getting to know this things, we will see how it goes

Hi world, 
so this is the beginning of my journey here, I still have a lot to learn. 
I don't know wether this will be a diary or just brainstorming some ideas, talking about things that happen in my life... we will see.
I just hope I won't stop after 1 week.

sooo let's begin ladies and gentlemen!

Here's what just happened, nothing too exciting so calm down...
It will probably turn out to be a scam but it doesn't really matter, like world and everything on this world lol
A girl from Hong Kong contacted me via fb dating, her name is Leila, which is very wierd for Asian girl ( my friend who was in Asia told me it's common for asian girls to change their names). She is really beutiful, and asked me for my whatsapp number...this has happend many times before so I'm not expecting much since they all turn out to be a scam but anyway... soo I gave her my number and she told me she will write me... i think the chances of her being real al close 0.
